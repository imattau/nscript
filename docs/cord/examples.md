# Concord Event Examples

**Non-normative.** One example per event kind in the frozen registry (CORD-02, Appendix B). The CORD documents are the source of truth; if an example here disagrees with a CORD, the CORD wins.

Conventions used throughout:

- `<angle brackets>` are placeholders. Keys, ids, and hashes are lowercase hex (x-only pubkeys and ids are 32 bytes / 64 hex chars) unless noted.
- `nip44_encrypt(key, {...})` stands for the NIP-44 ciphertext of the serialized inner event — shown structurally so the nesting is readable.
- Rumors (the innermost events) are **unsigned** and carry no `sig`; the seal carries the author's real signature (CORD-01).
- `["ms", "<0..999>"]` is the sub-second remainder; true event time is `created_at * 1000 + ms` (CORD-02 §4).
- Examples are illustrative, not verifiable test vectors: ids, signatures, and derived addresses are placeholders, not real derivations.

Retired kinds (`3300, 3301, 3304, 3305, 3307, 3311, 23308`) have no examples: their numbers are burned, never reused (CORD-02, Appendix B).

## 1. The envelope

Every durable plane event is the same three-layer shape (CORD-01): a kind `1059` **wrap** signed by the plane's derived stream key, containing a **seal** signed by the author's real key, containing the unsigned **rumor** that carries the functional kind. Sections 2–5 show only rumors; each rides inside this envelope at its plane's address.

### 1.1 Kind 1059 — the wrap, encrypted seal

Chat, Guestbook, and rekey planes use the **encrypted seal** (kind `20013`): the rumor is NIP-44-encrypted *again* inside the already-encrypted wrap, so it can never be lifted out as a standalone public event (CORD-02 §5).

Because the wrap reverses NIP-59 (fixed author, ephemeral `p`), delivery depends on relays **not** enforcing NIP-59's optional `p`-tag guard ("relays SHOULD only serve kind 1059 events intended for the marked recipient"): members subscribe by the stream author, and nobody is the random `p`. Communities must choose relays accordingly.

```jsonc
{
  "id": "<wrap id>",
  "kind": 1059,
  "pubkey": "<plane's stream pubkey>",            // e.g. channel_pk, guestbook_pk (CORD-02 §4)
  "content": nip44_encrypt(conv_key, {            // conv_key = NIP-44 self-ECDH of the stream key
    "id": "<seal id>",
    "kind": 20013,                                // encrypted seal
    "pubkey": "<author's real pubkey>",
    "content": nip44_encrypt(conv_key, {
      "id": "<rumor id>",
      "kind": 9,                                  // the functional kind (any §2–§5 rumor)
      "pubkey": "<author's real pubkey>",
      "content": "Hey chat!",
      "tags": [
        ["channel", "<channel_id>"],
        ["epoch", "0"],
        ["ms", "417"]
      ],
      "created_at": 1686840217
    }),
    "tags": [],
    "created_at": 1686840217,
    "sig": "<author's real signature>"
  }),
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<random ephemeral pubkey>"]            // ephemeral "p", fixed author — NIP-59 reversed (CORD-01).
                                                  // Keep this key's secret if you want to NIP-09-delete the wrap later (CORD-01).
  ],
  "created_at": 1686840217,
  "sig": "<stream key signature>"
}
```

### 1.2 Kind 20014 — the plaintext seal

The Control Plane **only** (CORD-02 §5). Same wrap, but the seal's `content` holds the rumor's serialized JSON string rather than ciphertext (byte-verbatim, CORD-01), so a compaction can re-wrap the signed edition into a new epoch with the signature intact (CORD-06). See §4 for the full Control edition example inside this seal.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 1059,
  "pubkey": "<control_pk>",                       // the control_root-derived signer: only staff can mint this wrap (CORD-02 §5)
  "content": nip44_encrypt(control_conv_key, {    // the community_root-derived read key: every member decrypts (CORD-02 §5)
    "id": "<seal id>",
    "kind": 20014,                                // plaintext seal
    "pubkey": "<actor's real pubkey>",
    "content": json_stringify({ /* the kind 3308 rumor, §4 */ }),  // the rumor's serialized JSON string, not a ciphertext
    "tags": [],
    "created_at": 1686840217,
    "sig": "<actor's real signature>"
  }),
  "tags": [ ["p", "<random ephemeral pubkey>"] ],
  "created_at": 1686840217,
  "sig": "<control signer signature>"
}
```

### 1.3 Kind 21059 — the ephemeral wrap

Identical structure to `1059`, but relays MUST NOT store it: broadcast to live subscribers and gone. Used only for the typing indicator (§2.7).

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 21059,
  "pubkey": "<channel_pk>",
  "content": nip44_encrypt(conv_key, { /* kind 20013 seal around a kind 23311 or 23313 rumor, §2.7–2.8 */ }),
  "tags": [ ["p", "<random ephemeral pubkey>"] ],
  "created_at": 1686840217,
  "sig": "<channel stream signature>"
}
```

## 2. Chat Plane rumors

All Chat rumors ride an encrypted seal (§1.1) at the Channel's address, and MUST commit `["channel", <channel_id>]` and `["epoch", <n>]` inside the author-signed rumor; a receiver checks both against the key that opened the wrap and drops a mismatch (CORD-03 §3).

When the Community's disappearing-messages timer is set (CORD-08), every durable Chat rumor **and its outer wrap** also carry NIP-40 `["expiration", "<created_at + timer>"]` — except deletes (§2.4) and timer notices (§2.9), which never expire. The examples below omit the tag.

### 2.1 Kind 9 — Message

NIP-C7 shape: the `content` is the message text. (Not NIP-29, whose messages require an `h` tag and whose kind 9 definition has since been dropped; the registry assigns kind 9 to NIP-C7.)

```jsonc
{
  "id": "<rumor id>",
  "kind": 9,
  "pubkey": "<author>",
  "content": "Hey chat!",
  "tags": [
    ["channel", "<channel_id>"],
    ["epoch", "0"],
    ["ms", "417"]
  ],
  "created_at": 1686840217
}
```

An **inline quote** embeds another message in the timeline with a `q` tag (NIP-C7), citing the quoted message's *rumor* id (never the outer wrap's, which differs per re-wrap). It stays a kind 9 and renders as an ordinary timeline row that happens to carry a quoted card:

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 9,
  "pubkey": "<author>",
  "content": "Welcome!",
  "tags": [
    ["channel", "<channel_id>"],
    ["epoch", "0"],
    ["ms", "902"],
    ["q", "<quoted message rumor id>", "", "<quoted author>"]
  ],
  "created_at": 1686840304
}
```

### 2.2 Kind 1111 — Threaded reply

A **threaded reply** is a distinct action from an inline quote: it lives in a thread hanging off its root, not as a top-level timeline row. It is a NIP-22 comment (kind `1111`), not a kind 9 — reusing `q` for this would conflate "quote this inline" with "reply in a thread". Uppercase `K`/`E`/`P` pin the immutable *thread root*; lowercase `k`/`e`/`p` pin the *immediate parent*. All ids are *rumor* ids (never the outer wrap's). When the parent is itself a reply, its uppercase root tags are inherited verbatim, so the root stays stable at any nesting depth:

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 1111,
  "pubkey": "<author>",
  "content": "Replying in the thread!",
  "tags": [
    ["channel", "<channel_id>"],
    ["epoch", "0"],
    ["ms", "744"],
    ["K", "9"],
    ["E", "<thread root rumor id>", "", "<root author>"],
    ["P", "<root author>"],
    ["k", "9"],
    ["e", "<immediate parent rumor id>", "", "<parent author>"],
    ["p", "<parent author>"]
  ],
  "created_at": 1686840360
}
```

Reactions, edits, and deletes target a threaded reply exactly as they target a kind-9 message (by its rumor id); the `k` tag they carry names the target's kind (`1111` for a reply, `9` for a message).

### 2.3 Kind 7 — Reaction

NIP-25 shape: `content` is the reaction (`"+"`, an emoji, …), tags name the reacted-to message, its author, and its kind.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 7,
  "pubkey": "<reactor>",
  "content": "🔥",
  "tags": [
    ["channel", "<channel_id>"],
    ["epoch", "0"],
    ["ms", "112"],
    ["e", "<message rumor id>"],
    ["p", "<message author>"],
    ["k", "9"]
  ],
  "created_at": 1686840350
}
```

### 2.4 Kind 5 — Delete

NIP-09 shape: `e` tags name the author's own rumors to delete, `k` their kind, `content` an optional reason. A member's delete of their own past message is honored always — even after Dissolution (CORD-02 §9).

Note this delete names a *rumor* id relays never saw, so it is semantic **within the plane only** — members stop rendering the message, but the wrap ciphertext stays on relays. Scrubbing the ciphertext itself is a separate, best-effort NIP-09 delete of the wrap by its `p` tag (CORD-01), possible only if the publishing client kept the ephemeral key.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 5,
  "pubkey": "<author>",
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["channel", "<channel_id>"],
    ["epoch", "0"],
    ["ms", "533"],
    ["e", "<own message rumor id>"],
    ["k", "9"]
  ],
  "created_at": 1686841000
}
```

### 2.5 Kind 3302 — Edit

The CORDs register the kind but don't yet pin its fields; this shape is illustrative. The `e` tag names the author's own message being edited, `content` the replacement text.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 3302,
  "pubkey": "<author>",
  "content": "Hey chat! (fixed the typo)",
  "tags": [
    ["channel", "<channel_id>"],
    ["epoch", "0"],
    ["ms", "781"],
    ["e", "<own message rumor id>"]
  ],
  "created_at": 1686840610
}
```

### 2.6 Kind 3310 — WebXDC peer signal

Realtime peer signaling for WebXDC apps. The CORDs register the kind but don't yet pin its payload; `content` is the app-level payload, opaque to the protocol.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 3310,
  "pubkey": "<author>",
  "content": "<app payload>",
  "tags": [
    ["channel", "<channel_id>"],
    ["epoch", "0"],
    ["ms", "266"]
  ],
  "created_at": 1686840700
}
```

### 2.7 Kind 23311 — Typing indicator

An **ephemeral** action: same seal-and-rumor shape at the same Channel address, but the outer wrap is kind `21059` (§1.3) and the rumor kind is ephemeral-range too, so relays never store any layer of it. Presence of the event is the signal; the rumor carries nothing.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 23311,
  "pubkey": "<author>",
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["channel", "<channel_id>"],
    ["epoch", "0"],
    ["ms", "45"]
  ],
  "created_at": 1686840216
}
```

### 2.8 Kind 23313 — Voice presence

Ephemeral like the typing indicator (`21059` wrap, §1.3): call heartbeats are realtime-only, nothing worth storing. The `content` is the verb; a `joined` repeats every 30 seconds carrying the broker-assigned SFU identity and the broker origin, goes stale after 90 seconds (three missed heartbeats), and a `left` omits both (CORD-07 §4).

```jsonc
// Joined (also the heartbeat)
{
  "kind": 23313,
  "pubkey": "<member>",
  "content": "joined",
  "tags": [
    ["channel", "<channel_id>"],
    ["epoch", "0"],
    ["identity", "<SFU identity>"],
    ["broker", "https://broker.example"],
    ["ms", "417"]
  ],
  "created_at": 1686840217
}

// Left (best-effort; a missed one heals by staleness)
{
  "kind": 23313,
  "pubkey": "<member>",
  "content": "left",
  "tags": [
    ["channel", "<channel_id>"],
    ["epoch", "0"],
    ["ms", "902"]
  ],
  "created_at": 1686840305
}
```

### 2.9 Kind 1740 — Timer notice

Posted by staff after changing the Community's disappearing-messages timer (CORD-08 §4), one per Channel whose key they hold — the same kind and `timer` tag NIP-17 disappearing-DM clients use. Rendered as an inline notice row; displayed only if the author holds `MANAGE_METADATA` in the fold. Never carries an `expiration` tag itself.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 1740,
  "pubkey": "<staff member>",
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["channel", "<channel_id>"],
    ["epoch", "0"],
    ["ms", "233"],
    ["timer", "2592000"]                          // the new timer in seconds; "0" = turned off
  ],
  "created_at": 1686845000
}
```

## 3. Guestbook Plane rumors

Encrypted seals (§1.1) at `guestbook_pk` (CORD-02 §5). The Guestbook coalesces flat — one final state per npub, latest wins by millisecond time, ties broken by the lower rumor id.

### 3.1 Kind 3306 — Join / Leave

Self-signed; the `content` is the verb. A Join MAY carry invite attribution echoed from the bundle (CORD-05 §1).

```jsonc
// Join, with optional invite attribution
{
  "kind": 3306,
  "pubkey": "<member>",
  "content": "join",
  "tags": [
    ["ms", "128"],
    ["invite", "<creator pubkey>", "Reddit"]      // optional, Joins only
  ],
  "created_at": 1719800000
}

// Leave
{
  "kind": 3306,
  "pubkey": "<member>",
  "content": "leave",
  "tags": [ ["ms", "660"] ],
  "created_at": 1722400000
}
```

### 3.2 Kind 3309 — Kick

Admin-signed, names its target, and cites the Grant it acts under (the `vac`, CORD-04 §5). Honored only if the signer holds `KICK` and strictly outranks the target.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 3309,
  "pubkey": "<admin>",
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["ms", "301"],
    ["p", "<target pubkey>"],
    ["vac", "<grant eid>", "<grant version>", "<grant edition hash>"]
  ],
  "created_at": 1722410000
}
```

### 3.3 Kind 3312 — Guestbook snapshot

Refounder-signed, seeding the new epoch's Guestbook after a Refounding (CORD-02 §5). Present members only, chunked at 400 per event; all `n` chunks share one snapshot id and one timestamp.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 3312,
  "pubkey": "<refounder>",
  "content": "[\"<member pubkey>\", \"<member pubkey>\", \"<member pubkey>\"]",
  "tags": [
    ["ms", "0"],
    ["snap", "<snapshot id>", "1", "2"]           // chunk 1 of 2
  ],
  "created_at": 1722500000
}
```

## 4. Control Plane — kind 3308 editions

Every authority action is a kind `3308` **edition** rumor inside a **plaintext seal** (§1.2) at `control_pk` — the staff-held signer's address (CORD-02 §5): every member subscribes, verifies, and reads it, but only a `control_root` holder can publish to it. The tags carry the edition machinery (CORD-04 §1); the `content` is the entity's new state as JSON, its structure selected by `vsk`.

The common frame:

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 3308,
  "pubkey": "<actor's real pubkey>",
  "content": "<the entity's new state, per-vsk below, as a JSON string>",
  "tags": [
    ["vsk", "1"],                                 // entity type (registry below)
    ["eid", "<entity id, 32-byte hex>"],          // the stable coordinate
    ["ev",  "4"],                                 // this edition's version, climbs from 1
    ["ep",  "<prev edition hash>"],               // chain link, absent on the first edition
    ["vac", "<grant eid>", "<grant version>", "<grant edition hash>"]  // absent when the owner acts
  ],
  "created_at": 1686840217
}
```

Per-`vsk` `content` payloads:

### vsk 0 — Community metadata (CORD-02 §6)

`eid` = the `community_id`. Gated by `MANAGE_METADATA`.

```jsonc
{
  "name": "Vector",
  "description": "Private messaging, no compromises.",
  "relays": ["wss://jskitty.com/nostr", "wss://asia.vectorapp.io/nostr"],
  "icon":   { "url": "https://blossom.example/…", "key": "<hex>", "nonce": "<hex>", "hash": "<sha256 hex>" },
  "banner": { "url": "https://blossom.example/…", "key": "<hex>", "nonce": "<hex>", "hash": "<sha256 hex>" },
  "message_expiration": 2592000,
  "custom": { "rules": "Be excellent to each other." }
}
```

### vsk 1 — Role (CORD-04 §2)

`eid` = the `role_id`, random 32 bytes minted at creation. Gated by `MANAGE_ROLES`.

```jsonc
{
  "role_id": "<role_id hex>",
  "name": "Moderator",
  "position": 2,
  "permissions": "40",                            // decimal string: 1<<3 KICK | 1<<5 MANAGE_MESSAGES
  "scope": { "kind": "server" },                  // or {"kind":"channel","channel_id":"<hex>"}
  "color": 15158332
}
```

### vsk 2 — Channel metadata (CORD-03 §2)

`eid` = the `channel_id`. Gated by `MANAGE_CHANNELS`. Every Channel is callable (CORD-07); there is no per-Channel voice flag.

```jsonc
{ "name": "general", "private": false }
{ "name": "lounge",  "private": false }
```

A deletion is an edition setting the terminal flag:

```jsonc
{ "name": "general", "private": false, "deleted": true }
```

### vsk 3 — Grant (CORD-04 §2)

`eid` = `grant_locator(community_id, member)` (CORD-02 A.6). Honored only if the signer outranks every Role handed out; empty `role_ids` is a revoke. A staff-making Grant also delivers the Control Plane write secret in `control_wrap` (CORD-04 §3): NIP-44 ciphertext under the granter↔member pairwise key, its plaintext the fixed-width 40 bytes `epoch_be[8] ‖ control_root[32]`, adopted only if the secret derives to the recipient's held `control_pk` at that epoch. Every other reader treats it as opaque bytes.

```jsonc
{
  "member": "<member pubkey>",
  "role_ids": ["<role_id hex>", "<role_id hex>"],
  "control_wrap": "<base64>"                      // optional: staff write key delivery (CORD-04 §3)
}
```

### vsk 4 — Banlist (CORD-04 §4)

`eid` = `banlist_locator(community_id)` (CORD-02 A.6). The whole list, replaced entire on every edit; signer must hold `BAN`.

```jsonc
["<banned pubkey>", "<banned pubkey>"]
```

### vsk 8 — Invite-link registry (CORD-05 §5)

`eid` = `invite_links_locator(community_id, creator)` (CORD-02 A.6). Locators only, never tokens or URLs; honored while its author holds `CREATE_INVITE`.

```jsonc
["<link_signer pubkey hex>", "<link_signer pubkey hex>"]
```

### vsk 11 — Pin List (CORD-04 §7)

`eid` = `pins_locator(community_id, channel_id)` (CORD-02 A.6). One list per Channel, replaced entire on every edit; signer must hold `PIN_MESSAGES`. Each entry carries the pinned message's original seal verbatim plus its one-shot NIP-44 message keys, so any reader able to open the list's form — including one holding no historical keys — verifies author, words, and time from the pin alone.

```jsonc
// Public Channel: plaintext — the plane's wrap is the gate, and compaction
// re-wrapping it to each new root keeps it readable forever.
{ "entries": [
    { "seal": { /* the original kind-20013 seal event, byte-verbatim */ },
      "keys": "<76 bytes hex: chacha_key[32] || chacha_nonce[12] || hmac_key[32]>",
      "wrap": "<hex event id>",    // optional: jump-to-context locator
      "edit": {                    // optional: the author's own Edit (kind 3302),
        "seal": { /* … */ },       // proven the same way, so a keyless reader
        "keys": "<76 bytes hex>"   // never reads superseded words as current
      } }
] }
```

```jsonc
// Private Channel: the same list, NIP-44-sealed under the Channel's group key
// at the named epoch (self-ECDH conversation key, CORD-01).
{ "epoch": "4", "sealed": nip44_encrypt(channel_conv_key, { "entries": [ … ] }) }
```

Caps: 25 entries and 32,768 bytes of `content`, judged on the carried bytes — a violating edition still folds and chains, but reads as an empty list (CORD-04 §7). An entry failing verification (seal kind, signature, MAC, decryption, unpad/parse, rumor kind, author equality, or the rumor's `channel` tag not matching this list's Channel) is dropped alone; an `edit` bundle failing the same checks — with kind `3302`, and additionally the Edit's author matching the original's and its `e` tag naming the original — costs only the revision, never the pin. A member's deletion of their own message kills its pin.

### vsk 10 — Dissolved tombstone (CORD-02 §9)

Owner-signed, chainless, exempt from version discipline — published at `dissolved_pk`, not the Control Plane address. Presence of one valid owner-signed edition *is* the state.

The `eid` is the `community_id`, and a verifier MUST check it: `dissolved_pk` derives from that id with no secret, so the plane is public to read and to sign at, and a payload naming no Community would let an owner's tombstone for one be re-wrapped to kill another (CORD-02 §9).

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 3308,
  "pubkey": "<owner>",
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["vsk", "10"],
    ["eid", "<community_id>"]   // binds the tombstone to the Community it kills
    // chainless: no ev, no ep, no vac
  ],
  "created_at": 1725000000
}
```

Remaining `vsk` values carry no edition: `5` is reserved, `6`/`9` are claimed by the addressable invite marker (§6.1), `7` is retired.

## 5. Rekeys — kind 3303

Delivered at a **rekey address** derived from the *prior* secret (CORD-06 §2), wrapped and encrypted-sealed like any stream event. The seal's npub is the Rotator, whose authority a receiver verifies before accepting anything.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 3303,
  "pubkey": "<rotator's real pubkey>",
  "content": "[ {\"locator\": \"<hex>\", \"wrapped\": \"<base64>\"}, {\"locator\": \"<hex>\", \"wrapped\": \"<base64>\"} ]",
  "tags": [
    ["scope",      "<channel_id hex>"],           // all-zero hex = the community_root (a Refounding)
    ["newepoch",   "3"],
    ["prevepoch",  "2"],
    ["prevcommit", "<epoch-key commitment hex, CORD-02 A.5>"],
    ["chunk",      "1", "2"]                      // this event is chunk 1 of 2 for the rotation
  ],
  "created_at": 1722500000
}
```

Each `wrapped` plaintext is fixed-width per form (CORD-06 §1): a Channel rotation's is 72 bytes — `scope_id[32] ‖ epoch_be[8] ‖ new_key[32]` — while a base rotation's appends the next epoch's Control Plane keys, 104 bytes for a member (`… ‖ new_control_pk[32]`) and 136 for a staff recipient (`… ‖ new_control_root[32]`). All are NIP-44-encrypted under the Rotator↔recipient pairwise key; the recipient finds their blob by computing their `locator` (CORD-06 §2) and verifies the inner scope and epoch against the tags before accepting the key — a staff recipient also that the delivered secret derives to the delivered pubkey. A 72-byte *base* blob marks a legacy, pre-split rotation (CORD-06 §3): honored when reading old epochs — its acceptor folds that epoch's Control at the legacy address — never minted by a compliant Rotator.

## 6. Outside the wrap

Three kinds relays see bare, signed by ordinary (or per-link) keys.

### 6.1 Kind 33301 — public invite bundle (CORD-05 §2)

Addressable, authored by the link's dedicated `link_signer` keypair with an empty `d` identifier — the coordinate `(33301, link_signer, "")` is exactly what the link's naddr names. The `vsk` tag marks it live (`6`) or a revocation tombstone (`9`).

The guard is the coordinate itself: a squatter's event is a different author, hence a different coordinate, and never matches the fetcher's filter. Since the `link_signer` secret lives only in the creator's Invite List (CORD-05 §4), a link-holder can preview and join but can never re-post, replace, or tombstone the bundle. And a hostile bundle can't smuggle a false owner regardless — the `community_id` self-certifies (CORD-05 §1).

```jsonc
// live bundle
{
  "kind": 33301,
  "pubkey": "<link_signer pubkey>",
  "content": "<nip44_encrypt(bundle_key, bundle)>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", ""],
    ["vsk", "6"]
  ],
  "created_at": 1719800000,
  "sig": "<link_signer signature>"
}
```

The encrypted bundle's plaintext (CORD-05 §1):

```jsonc
{
  "community_id": "<hex>",
  "owner": "<owner pubkey>",
  "owner_salt": "<hex>",                          // verify: community_id == sha256("concord/community" || owner || salt)
  "community_root": "<hex>",
  "root_epoch": 0,
  "control_pk": "<hex>",                          // the Control Plane signer's pubkey at that epoch (CORD-02 §5)
  "channels": [
    { "id": "<channel_id>", "key": "<hex>", "epoch": 1, "name": "testers" }
  ],
  "relays": ["wss://jskitty.com/nostr", "wss://relay.ditto.pub"],
  "name": "Vector",
  "icon": { "url": "https://blossom.example/…", "key": "<hex>", "nonce": "<hex>", "hash": "<sha256 hex>" },
  "expires_at": 1735689600000,                    // optional, unix ms
  "creator_npub": "<creator pubkey>",             // optional attribution
  "label": "Reddit"                               // optional attribution
}
```

Revoking the link re-posts the same coordinate as a tombstone:

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 33301,
  "pubkey": "<link_signer pubkey>",
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["d", ""],
    ["vsk", "9"]
  ],
  "created_at": 1722400000,
  "sig": "<link_signer signature>"
}
```

### 6.2 Kind 33302 — Community List (CORD-02 §8)

Addressable, one event per fragment, signed by their real key, NIP-44-encrypted to self. A client convenience, never Community state. The `d` tag is the fragment index in decimal; this is fragment `1` of a two-fragment List.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 33302,
  "pubkey": "<member's real pubkey>",
  "content": "<nip44_encrypt(self, fragment)>",
  "tags": [["d", "1"]],
  "created_at": 1722400000,
  "sig": "<member's real signature>"
}
```

The encrypted fragment's plaintext. Every 32-byte value is unpadded base64url at **any** depth, join material included:

```jsonc
{
  "frags": 2,                                        // how many fragments this List has
  "entries": [
    {
      "community_id": "PxpVK3nQ7sB1yTfWm4dLxZ0aRcE9uHgKjNvOpQrStUv",
      "current": {
        // community_id omitted — inherited from the entry
        "owner":          "nC7hQ2eRtYuIoPaSdFgHjKlZxCvBnM1qW3eR5tY7uI9",
        "owner_salt":     "qhEwR9tYuIoPaSdFgHjKlZxCvBnM1qW3eR5tY7uI0oP",
        "community_root": "d70Xa1QwErTyUiOpAsDfGhJkLzXcVbNm2Qw4Er6Ty8U",
        "root_epoch":     3,
        "control_pk":     "DU8vB4nM6qW1eR3tY5uI7oP9aS0dF2gH4jK6lZ8xC0v",
        "channels": [
          { "id":  "Ch1dQwErTyUiOpAsDfGhJkLzXcVbNm2Qw4Er6Ty8U0i",
            "key": "K3yAsDfGhJkLzXcVbNm1Qw2Er3Ty4Ui5Op6As7Df8Gh",
            "epoch": 2, "name": "staff" }
        ],
        "relays": ["wss://relay.example.com"],
        "name": "Example Community"
      },
      "added_at": 1719800000000                      // ms
      // seed omitted: this membership has never been refounded, so it equals current
    }
  ],
  "tombstones": [
    { "community_id": "u9RfLmWx3PqZtYvBnKjHgFdSaQwErTyUiOp2C4E6G8I", "removed_at": 1722400000000 }
  ]
}
```

Join material is the bundle's membership subset: `owner, owner_salt, community_root, root_epoch, control_pk, channels, relays, name`, plus `control_root` when held (CORD-02 §2) — never the icon, never the link fields. Embedded in an entry it omits `community_id`, inheriting the entry's; standalone (a CORD-06 §1 dissolution payload) it keeps it.

### 6.3 Kind 13303 — Invite List (CORD-05 §4)

Replaceable, one per user, signed by their real key, NIP-44-encrypted to self: the creator's private bookkeeping for minted links.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 13303,
  "pubkey": "<creator's real pubkey>",
  "content": "<nip44_encrypt(self, list)>",
  "tags": [],
  "created_at": 1722400000,
  "sig": "<creator's real signature>"
}
```

The encrypted list's plaintext:

```jsonc
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "token": "<hex>",                           // the link's unlock secret AND its merge key
      "signer_sk": "<hex>",                       // the link_signer secret (CORD-05 §2)
      "community_id": "<hex>",
      "url": "https://vectorapp.io/invite/<naddr>#<fragment>",
      "label": "Reddit",                          // optional
      "created_at": 1719800000,
      "expires_at": 1722400000                    // optional
    }
  ],
  "tombstones": [
    { "token": "<hex>", "community_id": "<hex>" }
  ]
}
```

## 7. Kind 3313 — Direct invite

The one event riding a **standard** NIP-59 giftwrap (CORD-05 §6): ephemeral wrap author, the recipient in the `p` tag, a kind `13` seal — not the reversed stream wrap of §1 — plus the outer `["k", "3313"]` that makes invites indexable. A recipient fetches exactly their invites with `{"kinds":[1059], "#p":["<me>"], "#k":["3313"]}`, no bulk decryption of their giftwrap inbox required. The outer tag is an unsigned hint; the rumor's kind is the authority.

The rumor carries the §6.1 `CommunityInvite` bundle itself as its content — no coordinate, no token, nothing to fetch — validated exactly as a fetched bundle: the self-certifying `community_id`, the CORD-05 §1 bounds, `expires_at`. It is a key handoff, not a standing door: unrevocable once landed, absent from the Registry, and it never flips the Community Public (CORD-05 §6). Nothing happens on receipt — no relay connection, no icon fetch, no Join — until the user accepts.

```jsonc
{
  "id": "<wrap id>",
  "kind": 1059,
  "pubkey": "<ephemeral pubkey, single-use>",
  "content": nip44_encrypt(ephemeral↔recipient, {
    "id": "<seal id>",
    "kind": 13,                                   // standard NIP-59 seal
    "pubkey": "<inviter's real pubkey>",
    "content": nip44_encrypt(inviter↔recipient, {
      "id": "<rumor id>",
      "kind": 3313,
      "pubkey": "<inviter's real pubkey>",
      "content": json_stringify({ /* the CommunityInvite bundle, §6.1 */ }),
      "tags": [],
      "created_at": 1719800000
    }),
    "tags": [],
    "created_at": 1719764213,                     // NIP-59: tweaked into the past
    "sig": "<inviter's real signature>"
  }),
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<recipient pubkey>"],                  // classic NIP-59: fixed recipient, ephemeral author
    ["k", "3313"],                                // the index hint (CORD-05 §6)
    ["expiration", "1735689600"]                  // optional NIP-40, matching the bundle's expires_at
  ],
  "created_at": 1719731502,                       // NIP-59: tweaked into the past
  "sig": "<ephemeral key signature>"
}
```
